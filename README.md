CommandKey
=========
Single use keys for running Bukkit commands.

Usage
-------
`/commandkey <command> [key]` - Creates a command key. If [key] is not provided, a random one is generated. (requires **commandkey.create**)

`/ck <command> [key]` - An alias of `/commandkey`, see above.

Replace all spaces in your command with `_`, so `say Testing` would become `say_Testing`.

`/activate <key>` - Activate a key (runs the command as console) (requires **commandkey.activate**)
